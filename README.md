To use these files, copy all files into the scripts directory of your deploymentshare.  Please note, if you have made previous modifications to DeployWiz_Definition_ENU.xml then you will want to modify it rather than just copying in this one.

You will also need to modify customsettings.ini as follows :
 *   Add a Custom Property like this : Properties=SkipAddPrinters
 *   Add this entry to show the wizard page : SkipAddPrinters=NO
